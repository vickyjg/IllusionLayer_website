                <p>In Spring 2019, Massachusetts College of Art and Design ran Disobedient Design, a new studio-hybrid elective that examined the power of public activism as it has evolved from letterpress broadsides to today’s acts of technological interventions.</p>
                <p>With a variety of analog and digital tools at their disposal, students considered the criteria for successful acts of resistance across different media through project deliverables ranging from letterpress posters, to digital installations, augmented reality experiences, and more.</p>

It came from Gillette, a traditionally male targeting razor brand who also own also owns Venus, the pink razor brand. However, they are still overtaxing women’s products. My poster critiques big brands using a social justice movements to benefit their business.”</p>

                            <p class="artistStatement">This is a response to to Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham’s statement towards LeBron James’s outspoken political views during an interview in early 2019. Laura Ingraham told LeBron to “shut up and dribble.” Just because he is an athlete doesn’t mean he can’t be political. At the time, I agreed with LeBron speaking out.</p>

                            <p class="artistStatement">My work is based on the phrase “come hell or high water.” I worked a lot with the composition of the piece. It was interesting experimenting in both the letterpress and AR. With the AR, I edited the sounds myself with found sounds to add another layer of meaning.</p>
